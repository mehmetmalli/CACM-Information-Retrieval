# CACM Information Retrieval
An information retrieval system written in Python, that uses the CACM collection for data. 
Made for an assignment of Text Mining class I am taking in my M.Sc. program.

### Notes:
- This is a dirty repo, not following best practices or clean coding principles, may not be using the most efficient methods.
- There are lots of commented out lines that were used for tinkering in the development and there may be variables that are not used.
- Solely coded to get results and write a report out of it.
